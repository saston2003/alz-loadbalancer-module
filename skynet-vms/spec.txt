I want a new folder
with a terraform configuration for
2 virtual machines
the virtual machines should be joined to a network I already have
the network is in resource group
m-spokeconfig-rg
and is called
SDSvNetTest-vnet
the vms should start with the name Skynet
and have 01 and 02
they should not be accessible publicly
they should comply with all known azure landing zone policies
