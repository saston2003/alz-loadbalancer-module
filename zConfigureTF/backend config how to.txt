The backend.config file is used to override backend configuration values when initializing Terraform. Here's how it works:

Where It's Used
The backend.config file is used with the terraform init command via the -backend-config flag:

terraform init -backend-config="backend.config"


What It Does
In your case, the backend.config file contains:

key = "storageacctimes3.tfstate"

This will override the key value defined in the backend block of your Provider-and-backend.tf file (which currently has key = "devbox.tfstate").

When you run terraform init -backend-config="backend.config", the Terraform state file will be stored as storageacctimes3.tfstate instead of devbox.tfstate in your Azure Storage backend.
